The purpose of this Web App is to predict patient prognosis for individuals affected by colorectal cancer. We utilize a combination of demographic, clinical, and genomic data to build accurate predictive models. The COADREAD notebooks, which stand for colorectal cancer, are designed to retrieve data from the TCGA project and perform data wrangling. The 'model' notebook prepares data for fitting predictive models, including logistic regression, KNN, random forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

Clinical and demographic data were obtained from the Genome Data Commons data portal, while genomic data, including gene mutations, gene expression, and methylation, was retrieved from the cBioPortal website.
